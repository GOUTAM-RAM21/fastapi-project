🚗 Car Price Prediction API

This project is a Machine Learning-powered API built using FastAPI to predict the selling price of a used car based on its characteristics.

📦 Project Features

🔐 Authentication: JWT-based token auth and API key validation
🧠 ML Model Prediction: Trained model predicts used car prices
⚡ Redis Caching: Avoid redundant model computation
📈 Monitoring Ready: Prometheus metrics + Grafana dashboards
🐳 Dockerized Setup: Simplified deployment with Docker Compose
☁️ Cloud Deployment: Easily deploy to Render
🧠 Model Input Variables
